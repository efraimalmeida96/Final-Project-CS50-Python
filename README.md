# Final Project for CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python**

**🧮 Calculus Calculator: Symbolic Differentiation and Integration**

This project is a **Calculus Calculator** developed in Python using the **SymPy** library. It is capable of performing symbolic operations such as differentiation and integration of mathematical functions.

## 📚 Overview

This calculator allows users to input a symbolic function, choose a variable, and either differentiate or integrate it—once or multiple times. It is especially useful when working with motion-related concepts such as **position**, **velocity**, and **acceleration**, which are related by calculus operations.

- **Differentiation order**:  
  `Position → Velocity → Acceleration`

- **Integration order**:  
  `Acceleration → Velocity → Position`

> To go from acceleration to position, two integrations are required.  
> To go from position to acceleration, two derivatives are needed.

This tool is a valuable aid for students and educators in mathematics, physics, and engineering.
